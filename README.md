## 📄 About

"Even the best designers produce successful products only if their designs solve the right problems.
A wonderful interface to the wrong features will fail." - Jakob Nielsen

📝 Talking about UI (user interface) is talking about how to create a simple, practical and efficient look to ensure that a user can perform tasks without needing an instruction manual. For this we have Nielsen's 10 heuristics, which help us to design an efficient interface with a good experience.
